// For this problem you must create a program that says who ate the last cookie. If the input is a string then "Zach" ate the cookie. If the input is a float or an int then "Monica" ate the cookie. If the input is anything else "the dog" ate the cookie. The way to return the statement is: "Who ate the last cookie? It was (name)!"

function cookie(x) {
  var t = typeof x
  var who = t=="string" ? 'Zach' : t=="number" ? 'Monica' : 'the dog'
  return `Who ate the last cookie? It was ${who}!`
}
console.log(cookie(32))
